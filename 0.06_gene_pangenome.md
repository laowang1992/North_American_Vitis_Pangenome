> Attribute a gene to a class based on its sequence composition.

When it is not for modeling purposes, it is easier to class genes into classes. Genes will be classed as core, disp or priv based on the nodes composing them, nodes for which we previously attributed a pangenome class. For example, a gene composed with > 80% of core nodes will be considered a core gene.

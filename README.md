***
> [! info] Purpose
> As of the beginning of 2022, the only tool proposing to build a pangenome without a reference bias is seqwish. Seqwish takes as input the alignments from wfmash. The constructed pangenome can be polished with smoothxg. The output of seqwish/smoothxg is compatible with the vg toolkit.
